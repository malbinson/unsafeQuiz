    <p>Looking for more effective ways to face change at work and in your life? Want to
    help your team be more creative when the stakes are high and time is tight?</p>

    <p>This five-minute quiz will reveal what you can do more of and what you should
    stop doing when it comes to breaking out of the safe thinking habits that most
    commonly hold us back.</p>

    <p>The diagnostic distills decades of research into the science of creativity and
    performance as well as more than 100 interviews I conducted with
    breakthrough unsafe thinkers. There are no right or wrong answers to the
    following questions. We all think in a mix of safe and unsafe ways and thus all
    have room to grow our ability to boldly face change.</p>
