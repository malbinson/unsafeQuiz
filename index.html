    <p><b>Looking for more effective ways to face change at work and in your life? Want to
        help your team be more creative when the stakes are high and time is tight?</b></p>

    <p>This five-minute quiz will reveal what you can do more of and what you should
    stop doing when it comes to breaking out of the safe thinking habits that most
    commonly hold us back.</p>

    <p>The diagnostic distills decades of research into the science of creativity and
    performance as well as more than 100 interviews I conducted with
    breakthrough unsafe thinkers. There are no right or wrong answers to the
    following questions. We all think in a mix of safe and unsafe ways and thus all
    have room to grow our ability to boldly face change.</p>

    <h2>EXPLORER’S MINDSET</h2>
    <p><h3 id="ex">Your Explorer’s Mindset Score: <span id="explore"></span></h3></p>
    <p class="descText">Self-identified “experts” like to dwell on what they know.
    Explorers often have just as much knowledge but they are
    driven more by curiosity about what they don’t yet know.
    Those with an Explorer’s Mindset learn more quickly
    because they have less ego-attachment to a position they
    took yesterday. They deliberately practice the things
    they’re weakest at, which is the fastest path to
    improvement. And they are predisposed to seeing change
    as a chance to experience something new rather than as a
    threat to their tried and true ways of operating.</p>

    <img src="img/scientific.png">
    <h2>SCIENTIFIC MINDSET</h2>
    <p><h3 id="sc">Your Scientific Mindset Score: <span id="science"></span></h3></p>
    <p class="descText">Those with a Scientific Mindset are always thinking
    critically about their own thinking. To be human is to have a
    host of automatic thoughts and biases — we can’t help it.
    But the scientific mindset helps us to understand these
    biases and recognize when they’re trapping you. People
    with a Scientific Mindset both trust their intuition but also
    constantly test to see if its signals are authentic or just
    prejudice in disguise. Those with a scientific mindset
    instinctively seek out information that might prove their
    thinking wrong while everyone else looks for evidence
    they’re right. Thus scientific thinkers are slower to form an
    opinion but less often get locked in mistaken thinking.</p>

    <img src="img/courageous.png">
    <h2>COURAGEOUS MINDSET</h2>
    <p><h3 id="co">Your Courageous  Mindset Score: <span id="courage"></span></h3></p>
    <p class="descText">People with a Courageous Mindset think counterintuitively
    about change. Instead of seeing anxiety as something to be
    avoided, it allows them to see fear as a sign they’re on their
    creative edge. Rather than seeing conflict as a threat, it
    exposes the generative power of disagreement and
    engaging with people who see the world very differently.
    And instead of seeing rules as ironclad restrictions to
    always be followed, the Courageous Mindset allows one to
    engage in “intelligent disobedience” from which
    breakthroughs so often emerge.</p>
