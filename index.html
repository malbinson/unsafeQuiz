    <h2>EXPLORER’S MINDSET</h2>
    <p><h3 id="ex">Your Explorer’s Mindset Score: <span id="explore"></span></h3></p>
    <p class="descText"><br>Self-identified “experts” like to dwell on what they know.
    Explorers often have just as much knowledge but they are
    driven more by curiosity about what they don’t yet know.
    Those with an Explorer’s Mindset learn more quickly
    because they have less ego-attachment to a position they
    took yesterday. They deliberately practice the things
    at which they’re weakest, which is the fastest path to
    improvement. And they are predisposed to seeing change
    as a chance to experience something new rather than as a
    threat to their tried and true ways of operating.</p>

    <img src="img/scientific.png">
    <h2>SCIENTIFIC MINDSET</h2>
    <p><h3 id="sc">Your Scientific Mindset Score: <span id="science"></span></h3></p>
    <p class="descText"><br>Those with a Scientific Mindset are always thinking
    critically about their own thinking. To be human is to have a
    host of automatic thoughts and biases — we can’t help it.
    But the scientific mindset helps us to understand these
    biases and recognize when they’re trapping us. People
    with a Scientific Mindset  trust their intuition but also
    constantly test to see if its signals are authentic or just
    prejudice in disguise. Those with a scientific mindset
    instinctively seek out information that might prove their
    thinking wrong. Thus scientific thinkers are slower to form an
    opinion but less often get locked in mistaken thinking.</p>

    <img src="img/courageous.png">
    <h2>COURAGEOUS MINDSET</h2>
    <p><h3 id="co">Your Courageous  Mindset Score: <span id="courage"></span></h3></p>
    <p class="descText"><br>People with a Courageous Mindset think counterintuitively
    about threats and challenges. Instead of seeing anxiety as something to be
    avoided, a Courageous Mindset allows them to see fear as a sign they’re on their
    creative edge. Rather than seeing conflict as a threat, the see the generative power of disagreement and
    engaging with people who view the world very differently.
    And instead of seeing rules as ironclad restrictions to
    always be followed, the Courageous Mindset allows one to
    engage in “intelligent disobedience” from which
    breakthroughs so often emerge.</p>
